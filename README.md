# 📊 Data Visualizations by Ángel

Hi! I'm Ángel, a PhD student learning how to code and build **professional-looking graphs** using economic datasets.  
This repository is my personal lab for exploring data visualization and improving my coding skills with **Stata** and **R** (maybe other languages in the future 👀).
I won't stop until I complete the Pokedex of economic graphs

## 🎯 Purpose

This project has three main goals:

1. **Learn how to code** more efficiently and professionally.
2. **Design beautiful, consistent, and customized graphs** formatted using my own visual style.
3. **Automate the full process**: from downloading and preparing data to producing final visualizations.
4. **Replicate and update** these graphs easily as new data becomes available.

One of my top priorities is to make all scripts as **automated** and **reproducible** as possible, so any graph can be updated in the future with just a few clicks.

## ✨ Inspiration

I often come across graphs on Twitter and social media that fascinate me —  
they **don’t just show data**, they **tell stories**. That’s exactly the kind of work I want to do.

So far, I’ve mostly worked on **time series line charts**, but I’m planning to explore new datasets, new types of plots, and new visual formats. Let me cook 👨‍🍳

## 🧰 Tools

- 📦 **R**: especially `ggplot2` for styling and flexibility.
- 🧮 **Stata**: my starting point, still useful for many tasks.
- 💾 Future plans: try out **World Bank**, **OECD**, and other sources.

I started with Stata, but quickly realized how comfortable and creative `ggplot2` is for certain types of visualizations.
I feel for now I'll remain on Stata for **econometric analisys**, but I'm thiking moving to R for **data visualization**.

## 📌 Disclaimer

I'm still learning. Please be nice 😊  
Some graphs may contain errors — they are **my own** and I take full responsibility.  
Everything here is done with care, curiosity, and a lot of love for data 💙
